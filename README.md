# End of Term Web Archive

This is the public repository to collect seed lists for the End of Term Web Archive project for the 2024 electoral season. The End of Term Web Archive is a collaborative initiative that collects, preserves, and makes accessible United States Government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Beginning in 2008, the End of Term Web Archive has thus far preserved websites from administration changes in 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024.

For the End of Term 2024 web archive, [partners](https://eotarchive.org/partners/) have joined together to preserve public United States Government websites of the presidential administration ending January 20, 2025, collaborating to select, collect, preserve, and make the web archives available for public access and research use. This archive is intended to document and preserve the federal government's presence on the web during the presidential transition and to expand and enhance the existing collections of the partner institutions.

## Collecting Scope
The End of Term Web Archive contains federal government websites (.gov, .mil, government websites not on the .gov domain, government social media accounts, public-nominated government sites, etc.) in the Legislative, Executive, or Judicial branches of the government. Local or state government websites or any other sites not part of the federal government domain are considered out of scope; however, some websites exist in a liminal space that makes "official" federal status hard to determine. The website seed lists published in this repository represent the full extent of the sites selected for archiving.

The project also solicits public nominations of websites to include in the archive. The online nomination tool for 2024 can be found at [End of Term 2024 Nomination Tool](https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2024/about/). 

## Project Scope
The project has two phases: A broad, comprehensive baseline crawl of identified websites and more selective, focused crawls based on priorities established by the partners.

**Comprehensive Crawl** - The Internet Archive will undertake a comprehensive crawl of the URLs identified for this project beginning in October 2024 and again in early 2025 after the inauguration.

**Prioritized Crawl** - The project team is calling upon government information specialists, including librarians, political and social science researchers, and academics to assist in the selection and prioritization of the selected web sites to be included in the collection, as well as identifying the frequency and depth of collecting.
